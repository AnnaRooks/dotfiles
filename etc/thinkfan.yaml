# Sensor Drivers and Temperature Inputs
# =====================================
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which sensors are specified here is significant when
# specifying the fan speeds further below!
#
# There are multiple ways in which a temperature input can be specified. An
# example for each is given below.
#
# The "correction:" and "optional:" keywords may be specified on any type of
# sensor.

sensors:
  # hwmon: Base path with name-based search
  # =======================================
  # Thinkfan will search under the given path for a hwmon driver that has a
  # file called "name" which contains the given name. This method should work
  # with all hwmon drivers and is robust against driver load order.
  - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
    name: acpitz
    indices: [1, 2]

  - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
    name: coretemp
    indices: [1, 2, 3]

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.
#
fans:
  #  # hwmon: Base path with name-based search
  #  # =======================================
  #  - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
  #    name: thinkpad
  #    indices: [1]

  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared agains these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
#
levels:
  - [0, 0,  37]
  - [1, 35, 42]
  - [2, 40, 47]
  - [3, 45, 52]
  - [4, 50, 57]
  - [5, 55, 62]
  - [6, 60, 67]
  - [7, 65, 72]
  - ["level full-speed", 70, 77]
  - ["level disengaged", 75, 32767]

# Fan Speeds (detailed mode)
# ==========================
#
# It is generally advisable to configure the temperature limits for each
# sensor individually.
#
# The speed values used here range from 0 to 255, which is valid for the PWM
# control files used by hwmon-based drivers.
#
# The temperatures specified in upper_limit and lower_limit apply to the
# sensors in the same order in which they were specified in the "sensors:"
# section above, and their length must match the total number of sensors that
# have been configured.
#
#levels:
#  - speed: 0
#    upper_limit: [50, 50, 50]
#
#  - speed: 100
#    lower_limit: [45, 45, 45]
#    upper_limit: [65, 65, 65]
#
#  - speed: 255
#    lower_limit: [60, 60, 60]
